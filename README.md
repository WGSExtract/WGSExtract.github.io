Still waiting for your WGS test results?  Want to get started today?  See the [International Genome Sample Resource (1K Genome archive)](https://www.internationalgenome.org/data) for BAM files that you can download and play with to learn the tool while waiting for your results.

This tool is geared toward the needs of [genetic genealogy](https://h600.org/wiki/Genetic+Genealogy) but may be helpful for those looking into health-releated uses of [WGS](https://h600.org/wiki/WGS) tests. The **sub-$500, Direct-to-Consumer (DTC), 30x Whole Genome Sequence (WGS) tests** are delivered with basic data files and reports. This tool serves to bridge the gap between the [WGS files](https://h600.org/wiki/Sequencing+File+Formats) delivered and the present day [genetic genealogy community tools](https://h600.org/wiki/Third+Party+Analysis+Tools). Many health analysis sites accept the microarray and VCF files generated by this tool as well.

This tool is designed to be a simple, push-button manipulation of [WGS files](https://h600.org/wiki/Sequencing+File+Formats) from any source. It hides the scripting of complex bioinformatic tools and automatically determines needed parameters and variances for the data supplied it.  For more control over your pipeline, either learn to use the underlying tools directly in a command shell or seek a Galaxy server (such as [UseGalaxy](https://usegalaxy.org/)).

[Dante Labs](https://genome.dantelabs.com), [Nebula Genomics](https://nebula.org/), and [ySeq](https://yseq.net/) are test results most commonly used with this tool. [Full Genomes Corp](https://fullgenomes.com/]), [Sano Genetics](https://sanogenetics.com), [Sequencing](https://sequencing.com/) and [Veritas (historical)](https://veritasgenetics.com) are other test providers. These are all results from [Illumina](https://illumina.com) or [MGI](https://en.mgi-tech.com/) sequencers.  Results from [Oxford Nanopore](https://nanoporetech.com/) and [PacBio HiFi](https://www.pacb.com/smrt-science/smrt-sequencing/hifi-reads-for-highly-accurate-long-read-sequencing/) are also used; as is [FamilyTreeDNA](https://familytreedna.com/)'s BigY product. (This is not an endorsement of any company or service; simply reporting what we commonly encounter.)

We use the Facebook group [Consumer WGS Testing](https://www.facebook.com/groups/373644229897409/) for discussions on how to make use of your **sub-$500, DTC 30x WGS test** results. Bugs, use cases and announcements about this tool happen there.  As part of that Facebook groups' Files section, you will find a number of useful companion documents and tool references.  In particular, start with [Bioinformatics for Newbies](http://bit.ly/38jnxnK). 

User issues, if not brought up in the [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/373644229897409/), should be raised in the [user issues section of this site](https://github.com/WGSExtract/WGSExtract.github.io/issues). The local issues section is preferred so code bugs, use limitations and suggested improvements can be tracked within the development project.

The tool acronym is **WGSE** and pronounced as "wig-see". We encourage that use in conversation.

Developer's should visit the main GitHub [WGS Extract Developers Code Repository](https://github.com/WGSExtract/WGSExtract-Dev/).  Development issues, code bugs and limitations should be [raised in the development issues section](https://github.com/WGSExtract/WGSExtract-Dev/issues) so they are tracked till resolved in a release.

We bring you v3 after 16 months of v2 and 6 months of v1 before that.  The original, first 2 years [v1 and v2 historical release is documented here](https://github.com/WGSExtract/WGSExtract-Historical). Many thanks to Marko for his original effort there. Especially the microarray generator.

This page is located at [https://WGSExtract.github.io/](https://WGSExtract.github.io/) and serves as the WWW home for the tool. As the need develops, we will create our own Facebook Group for users to raise issues outside of the [User Issues Section](https://github.com/WGSExtract/WGSExtract.github.io/issues) already mentioned.

The tool has the potential to be a simple install in a BioConda environment as it is a Python package. But a majority of our users are on Microsoft Windows 10 systems. Bioconda nor the bioinformatic tools are available there. So we currently deliver the tool with our own installers and Win10 executables when needed. This may change going forward after we find a Win10 package manager to supply the bioinformatic tool ports. We fully test and use the Win10, Ubuntu Linux and Apple MaxOS versions; on Intel, AMD and Apple M1 (Arm) architectures. This is the only source of the bioinformatic tools on a Win10 system (that we are aware of).

**Win10 Release Users**
Some have downloaded the **WGSE** tool solely to gain access to the Win10 native executables of the Bioinformatic Tools that we make available.  These are installed as part of the Win10 Installer package.  You can download and use these Bioinformatic tools without installing the whole **WGS Extract** program; if you desire.

* **Win10 [CygWin64 full Bioinformatic](https://bit.ly/3jrXjrA)** environment (86 MB) ([MS Onedrive alternate](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AgorjTSMFYpjgQFkYV9HW0WbI1nS?e=rLSnLo)); A full, basic CygWin64 release with matching Bioinformatic tool v1.12 release. As of June 2021, the release includes htslib 1.12 from April 2021.

This is a more complete environment than provided by the WGS Extract installation.  A minimal, but typical CygWin64 install using the same version DLLs as the compiled bioinformatic tools (which are also included).

We install a less-than-minimal, usable Cygwin64 release during the **WGS Extract** tool install.  The original files used by the installer are here:
* **Win10 [CygWin64 partial](https://bit.ly/3q2Z3sn)** environment (11 MB) ([MS Onedrive alternate](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AgorjTSMFYpjcGO3m9V1V_i-mho?e=zLr3h4)); minimal to support the Bioinformatic Tools and WGS Extract installer
* **Win10 [CygWin64 Bioinformatic](https://bit.ly/2RZG05K)** tools (43 MB) ([MS Ondedrive alternate](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AgorjTSMFYpjeWbKyVRfkb1yTnI?e=2ZgeMZ)); hstlib, samtools, bcftools, bwa, etc
* **[Merge of the above two](https://bit.ly/3epnGeQ)** tool sets (56 MB) ([MS Onedrive alternate](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AgorjTSMFYpjgQALD5Ljnr4m6ozf?e=m1vjed)); already overlaid and combined as happens during installation)

The first two immediately above are used by the installer directly and in stages.  It merges or overlays them on top of each other.  As a result, we provide the merged form directly as the third link above; for your concenience.  The CygWin64 environment installed with the **WGS Extract** tool is minimal to what the installers and **WGS Extract** need. The installer uses MS Onedrive links to only the first two above.

The CygWin64 tools can be slower on a Win10 platform than the Win10 WSL environment running Ubuntu Linux with Linux versions of the bioinformatic tools installed directly.  Once WSLG becomes more complete and supported in Win11, we will likely avoid delivering Win10 executables all together and simply ask Windows users to install and use WSLG for running **WGS Extract**. At which time we can consider becoming a Bioconda package as well.  As of Spring 2021, you can get WSLG with the Win11 release as part of the [Windows Insiders program](https://insider.windows.com/).  We do not provide support for this use of **WSGE** on **WSLG** at this time.
