You do NOT need to download the Full release.  The installer will grab it for you.  It is provided here, as a direct link, for complete documentation and licenseing requirements.

If you have any version installed, you can overlay the Installer scripts in the same directory and they will work to save the large reference genome files for reuse so you can avoid the large download.  See the 00README.txt, Release Notes and [Manual (Google Doc)](https://bit.ly/35IziTY) for more information on installing. The installer grabs locally hosted files from Microsoft Onedrive.  The primary links above are to Google Drive.

Still waiting for your WGS test results?  Want to get started today?  See the [International Genome Sample Resource (1K Genome archive)](https://www.internationalgenome.org/data) for BAM files that you can download and play with to learn the tool while waiting for your results.

This tool is geared toward the needs of [genetic genealogy](https://h600.org/wiki/Genetic+Genealogy) but may be helpful for those looking into health-releated uses of [WGS](https://h600.org/wiki/WGS) tests. The **sub-$500, Direct-to-Consumer (DTC), 30x Whole Genome Sequence (WGS) tests** are delivered with basic data files and reports. This tool serves to bridge the gap between the [WGS files](https://h600.org/wiki/Sequencing+File+Formats) delivered and the present day [genetic genealogy community tools](https://h600.org/wiki/Third+Party+Analysis+Tools). Many health analysis sites accept the microarray and VCF files generated by this tool as well.

This tool is designed to be a simple, push-button manipulation of [WGS files](https://h600.org/wiki/Sequencing+File+Formats) from any source. It hides the scripting of complex bioinformatic tools and automatically determines needed parameters and variances for the data supplied it.  For more control over your pipeline, either learn to use the underlying tools directly in a command shell or seek a Galaxy server (such as [UseGalaxy](https://usegalaxy.org/)).

We use the Facebook group [Cpnsumer WGS Testing](https://www.facebook.com/groups/373644229897409/) for discussions on how to make use of your **sub-$500, DTC 30x WGS test** results. Bugs, use cases and announcements about this tool happen there.  As part of that Facebook groups' Files section, you will find a number of useful companion documents and tool references.  In particular, start with [Bioinformatics for Newbies](http://bit.ly/38jnxnK).

User issues, if not brought up in the [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/373644229897409/), should be raised in the [user issues section of this site](https://github.com/WGSExtract/WGSExtract.github.io/issues). The local issues section is preferred so code bugs, use limitations and suggested improvements can be tracked within the development project.

The tool acronym is **WGSE** and pronounced as "wig-see". We encourage that use in conversation.

Developer's should visit the main GitHub [WGS Extract Developers Code Repository](https://github.com/WGSExtract/WGSExtract-Dev/).  Development issues, code bugs and limitations should be [raised in the development issues section](https://github.com/WGSExtract/WGSExtract-Dev/issues) so they are tracked till resolved in a release.

We bring you v3 after 16 months of v2 and 6 months of v1 before that.  The original, first 2 years [v1 and v2 historical release is documented here](https://github.com/WGSExtract/WGSExtract-Historical). Many thanks to Marko for his original effort there. Especially the microarray generator.

This page is located at https://WGSExtract.github.io/ and serves as the WWW home for the tool. As the need develops, we will create our own Facebook Group for users to raise issues outside of the [User Issues Section](https://github.com/WGSExtract/WGSExtract.github.io/issues) already mentioned.

The tool has the potential to be a simple install in a BioConda environment as it is a Python package. But a majority of our users are on Microsoft Windows 10 systems. Bioconda nor the bioinformatic tools are available there. So we currently deliver the tool with our own installers and Win10 executables when needed. This may change going forward after we find a Win10 package manager to supply the bioinformatic tool ports we develop here. We fully test and use the Win10, Ubuntu Linux and Apple MaxOS versions; on Intel, AMD and Apple M1 (Arm) architectures. This is the only source of the bioinformatic tools on a Win10 system (that we are aware of).

**Win10 Release Users**
Some have downloaded the tool solely to gain access to the Win10 native executables of the Bioinformatic Tools that we make available.  These are installed as part of the Win10 Installer package.  They rely on locally sourced blobs. You can download and use these blobs without installing the whole **WGS Extract** program; if you desire.

* **Win10 [CygWin64 partial](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lYZbFJ3eyDps7e4I_Yu4zVyZz_vjjVcd/view?usp=sharing)** environment (11 MB); minimal to support the Bioinformatic Tools and WGS Extract installer
* **Win10 [CygWin64 Bioinformatic](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xf24oYYieU6SuiNFkrHG01qNwyJXZdKE/view?usp=sharing)** tools (43 MB); hstlib, samtools, bcftools, bwa, etc
* **[Merge of the above two](https://bit.ly/3epnGeQ)** tool sets (56 MB); already overlaid and combined as happens during installation)
* **Win10 [CygWin64 full](https://bit.ly/2TtArgn)** environment (46 MB); minimal CygWin64 install but the full, basic CygWin64 release with matching DLL versions for the above Bioinformatic tool release. As of June 2021, the release includes htslib 1.12 from April 2021.

The first two are used by the installer directly and in stages.  It merges or overlays them on top of each other.  As a result, we provide the merged form directly as the third link above.  The CygWin64 environment is minimal to what the installers and **WGS Extract** tool need. If you wish to have a more complete environment, we have provided the capture of a minimal, typical CygWin64 install as the fourth link above.  It is using the same version code and DLLs as the compiled bioinformatic tools in the second (and third) links.  You will need to merge / overlay this last link with the second (or third) to get the more complete Bioinformatic tool release and a complete CygWin64 BASH environment.

The CygWin64 tools tend to be slower on a Win10 platform than the Win10 WSL environment running Ubuntu Linux with tools available there.  Once WSLG becomes more complete and supported, w will likely avoid delivering Win10 executables and simply ask Win10 users to install and use WSLG for **WGS Extract**. At which time we can consider becoming a Bioconda package as well.
